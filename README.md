Projects Underway
Image recognition using convolutional neural networks
Sentiment analysis using natural language processing techniques
Collaborative filtering-based recommendation system
2. Data Science
Data science is an interdisciplinary field that involves extracting valuable insights from data using scientific methods, processes, and algorithms. Here, you will find projects that demonstrate the power of data science in solving complex problems and uncovering hidden patterns in data.

Projects Underway
Predictive analytics using regression models
Customer segmentation using clustering techniques
Anomaly detection in time series data
3. Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from digital attacks, damage, or unauthorized access. In this section, you will find projects that focus on various aspects of cybersecurity, such as network security, cryptography, and vulnerability analysis.

Projects Underway
Intrusion detection system using machine learning techniques
